This is a simple Todo app built with Svelte, the app allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks.

I am just a student.

## Features

- Add a new task by typing in the input field and pressing the "Add" button or pressing Enter.
- Mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox next to the task.
- Remove a task by clicking the "Remove" button next to the task.
- The app uses `localStorage` to persist tasks, so your tasks will be saved even if you close the browser or refresh the page.
